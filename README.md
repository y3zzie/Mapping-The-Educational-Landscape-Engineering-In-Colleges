# Mapping-The-Educational-Landscape-Engineering-In-Colleges
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of engineering colleges across India using data collected from sources like Careers360 and Kaggle. It explores key factors such as course offerings, fee structures, and infrastructure facilities including labs, hostels, and libraries. By comparing government and private institutions, the project provides meaningful insights to support decision-making for students, parents, and policymakers. The analysis is done using Python, with tools like Pandas, BeautifulSoup, and Matplotlib, and presented through Jupyter Notebooks. All code, data, and visualizations are organized for easy exploration and use.
